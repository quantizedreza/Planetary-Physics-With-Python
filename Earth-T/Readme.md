File: Fit.py resembles ENSO, which is not well understood in planetary physics and so are the sea surface temperature variations.

Does an increase in CO2 cause an increase in Temperature?

CO₂ is not acting as a meaningful driver of temperature on the timescale and in the data we are looking at. As it correlates positively, only half of the time. 

Let's look at the "Global" picture:

Back in the day (1975), a Newsweek article claimed that the earth was cooling. "The Cooling World" article is available [here](https://ia801508.us.archive.org/4/items/GlobalCoolingNewsweekArticle1975/GlobalCoolingNewsweekArticle1975_text.pdf).

# Temperature Timeseries in United States:
35+ years of continuous measurements. Systemic errors associated with these measurements are errors caused by calibration, urban heat island radiation from nearby sources (close to weather stations) and other factors which might affect the error. That number is unknown.

U.S. temperature data timeseries from NOAA.
